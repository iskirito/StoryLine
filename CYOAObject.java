You all were always into the filming industry and even put it as your major for college, yall have been with each other since the beginning.

Wuggles: "Hey guys I think this is it”
You look out the already dark window, seeing a huge house, a mansion about the size of 3 stories and many windows that seem to go to almost every room. It seems run down and untouched in many years, but it's perfect for your group's scene. 
Mchensy: “This horror film is gonna be great! Not only do we have already great props, but we also now have a perfect set!”
The college film you guys are filming, in particular, is a monster horror, planning to use CGI and props to have an emulated monster chase down different members of the crew. Even if you step out of the van and start collecting items, it's a great set for what you guys need.
You grab your camera, your film stands, your backpack, your lucky lighter, and your tool belt for your camera, including a long line of 尺๏尸ヨ in case you need to hang props or such for scenes. You have a lot on you, considering you have always been pretty fit. As your friends continue to grab their items as well you decide to head in a straightway walking up the couple steps of the wood porch to the front door of the house, slowly turning the knob and opening the door. You're greeted with a huge room with hallways left and right and an upper floor with staircases on each side of the room going to the upper floors, also with halls. Your friends walking behind you immediately get excited and start setting up to film, while it is hard to see in the house, the cameras have night vision, not only adding to the film but also being able to let us see. As you see everything in a dark hue of green you couldve sweared out the corner of your camera you saw something at least 8 feet tall move quickly behind the hall to your left. You immediately think it's your imagination, but just in case you decide to… +\n "choose by number" +"1.check the hall where the movement was with Staffard"+\n "2.tell your friends about what you saw"+\n "3.walk to the right side hall"+\n "4. mention the upstairs"+\n "5.

Staffard: if i remember correctly all the doors to the houses should be locked from what i heard…
You shrug not knowing why he had such information, but knowing this puts you to worry. You try to stop Staffard from going to the door to open it, but knowing your friend's curiosity for the unknown just follows from behind until at the door. As he slowly opens it the rooms pitch black, more than the house already is. As Staffard turns around to you he laughs.
Staffard: paranoia eh, take a picture of me, this room is so much darker then the rest of the house, wanna see what it looks like through the vision on the camera.
As you laugh it off with him you pull the camera to your eyes… 8ft figure looms overhead him from behind, you instantly turn from laughing to sorrow as you see  huge claw goe straight through staffards innards, also piercing you, you both gag blood as you try to get out of its claw, it throws you both to the ground. y̴̟̗͋̉̐ộ̶̡̌u̴̩̜̤̅͛̀̏r̵͈̲̰̖̂͂̊͘͜ ̴̡̪̖̮͚͗s̸̬͈̘͔̍̀ç̵̥͈͙̇ȃ̵͉̲͊̇͊͘r̵̢̗͊̊̆͂̇ë̸̮͇͈̻́͐̆͛ď̴̢͈͔̻̯̚ ̵͓̜̿y̵̧̩̰͑̚o̴̹̤̞̮͖͂̂̅̚ǔ̸̢̺̩͈͑͋̚͝r̷͚̮͇̃̈̇̈́̕ ̴̭̇s̴̘͍̱͑c̵̱̎a̷̙̖̩͗r̶̪͕͉͔̓́͊̿̕ĕ̵̩̓̄d̵͐̓͜ ̴͖̬͈̞̭̀̑̇́y̸͕̘̺͈͈͊̽ò̷̬͂̀̏u̶͇̝̓̐r̷͓̣̖̋ ̶̨̠̠͎̋̈́̚͜͝s̸̩̖̭͎̆̅̋c̷̹̭͍̮̈̄̍̽̀͜a̸͍̓͠ṙ̵̞̤̥͝ȩ̶͔̳̏̐̓͋͜d̶͍̕ͅ ̸̰͂y̶͕̳̐̎o̷̟͉̒͒̔͗̂u̷͙͔͙͋r̶͈̲̂́̅͝͝ ̶̹̼̣̯͝s̸̈́́͋͜ć̴̢̲͚̖̥̃͋́͝a̴̦̿͐̚r̶̤̫̖͗͝ẽ̷̟̯̂ͅd̴̲̬͖̝́͠ͅ ̷͓̤͍̯̋̽̈́̿y̷̟̜̙͑̎o̸͙̩̦̥̙̓ů̸̘̦̝̽͛̀̊r̸̙͈͈̄̒͆̋͠ ̸̮̦̼̝͆͑s̵͖̦̱̼̈́̀ć̸̢̞̪̋̃a̷͍̘̓̈́r̴̜̮̯͐́͜ͅe̶͇̓̄̓̇̑d̷̛̤͙͎̏̆ ̵͉͙͓̉y̶̟̘̮͆̀̄̄ŏ̶̲̤̓u̸͕͊͑r̸̐͂͜͝ ̸̛̪̦̳͈̔̅s̶̡̨̺̞̐̈͠c̴͎̠̠͇͝ä̴̞͕̳̝̹́͛͌r̵̝͈͋̐͠e̶̩̘̎d̵̪̟͚͉̻̾̓̊ ̷̦͍̞̽͐̊͝y̷̑̏̿̃̏͜o̴̘̰͇͈͆͋͂ũ̴͓̑͘ř̶̼̮͎̱̔ ̴̨̭̏̇̑s̴͚̦͍̪̲̈́c̷̘͛à̶͎͚̯͋̇r̷̨̧͍̔̐́e̶͕͋̈d̴̦̥̀̅͗ ̷̟̯̰̞̈́̋̉̓͋y̸̧̬͇̘͌̄ō̷̼͕̯͝ú̵̦̥͔̥̯r̸̡͉̭̲̠͗̈́ ̸̧̬̞̭͔̊̍̚s̵̻̹͉̆͒͒ç̴̻̟̹̝͌͠a̴͍̟̻͊̅̔́r̷̡͍͔͍̍̽̾e̶̦̾̇d̶̢͓͛͝͠ ̸̰̹̀̉͐̋y̴͍̞͗̄̿͘o̶̺͂͌u̷̡͈͓̟̫̒r̸̛̮͔͆ ̶͉̦͎̋̇̀ṣ̴̗̳́̈́̌̽͠c̸̺͙͙͍̾͊͒͊ă̵̺̱̲̎̑r̶͍͕̋͆e̶̯̬̗͚͈͑̔̓ḋ̸̹̪̗ ̶̳̫̪̻͗̍͜ you dont want to die, you try to stand slowly getting up with help from the wall, then your vision turns backwards.
